# 📉 Global Layoffs SQL Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores global tech and startup layoffs using SQL.  
The dataset initially contained messy, unstructured records of company layoffs across different industries, locations, and funding stages.  

I cleaned the data into a structured format, then performed exploratory SQL analysis to uncover **trends by company, year, and industry**.  

The project demonstrates skills in **data cleaning, transformation, and SQL-based analytics**.

## 🛠️ Process

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and standardized column formats.  
- Fixed inconsistent date formats.  
- Converted text-based fields (e.g., percentages, funds raised) into numeric values.  
- Dealt with missing values (e.g., NULLs in total laid off and percentages).  

➡️ Result: a clean, well-structured dataset like this:

### 2. Exploratory SQL Analysis
- Aggregated total layoffs per company and per year.  
- Ranked companies by total layoffs.  
- Compared industries and geographic distributions.
